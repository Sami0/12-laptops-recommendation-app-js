# 12-laptops-recommendation-app-js

<br>
<br>

<p>this is a simple application built with vanilla js, to recommend 12 different laptops based on 12 different user input  combinations, 
<a href="https://qrs0v.csb.app/">demo can be seen here on codesandbox </a></p>

the app accepts extact combination of <a href="https://dpjh9.csb.app/"> laptops listed here  </a>

<li> like Mac + 500 GB storage + 16GB-32GB of RAM + 1000-1500 price range </li>
or 
  <li>PureOS + any storage + 64 GB of RAM + 1000-1500 price range </li>

<br/>
the app is built with programmers and people who care about RAM and storage memory in mind , when it's a determining factor for Laptop purchase choice.
<br/>

it helps the user see how PureOS, Ubuntu, Mac , Windows compare.

the data is stored as simple js objects in one file, because the combination of choices is limited.

we know the limitation of the code structure and why it's not scalable.

however when there is small business selling only 12 products or when the use case is any fixed pre-determined data this is an appropriate approach, especially when development speed is the priority and not scalability.

this is also a demonstration for how plain js can be useful without any js libraries or frameworks. 

see <a href="https://github.com/Sami0/react-product-recc-1"> react-product-recc-1 repo </a>for implmentation of encapsulation using react library to make the code more reusable.
